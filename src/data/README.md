# Datum Parser

## Converting existing CSV to JSON

1. When the datum is updated, rename the CSV file to ``` datum.csv ``` 
2. When the entities are updated, rename the CSV file to ``` entities.csv ```
2. Drag ``` datum.csv ```  and ``` entities.csv ```into this folder.
3. Run ``` python csvToJsonParser.py ```
4. The contents of ``` datum.csv ``` will now be in JSON format in ``` ./datum.json``` and ``` entities.csv ``` will now be in ```./entities.json```

## Logic reversals of datums
