## Meeting Agenda

### Upcoming deadlines

My thesis submission deadline is Monday 29th June 2020, 5pm.
I plan to work solely on the interface until 29th May 2020, and then strictly on the thesis until the deadline.

I'd like to have another meeting closer to the 29th to discuss:
* Structure of the thesis
* Optimal date for first/second drafts to ensure maximum opportunity for feedback
* Overall research questions

### External examiner change

Tehri Numikko-Fuller is examiner 1
Sabrina Caldwell is replacement for Kerry Taylor for my examiner 2

### LaTeX as honours thesis tool?

Is it worth learning LaTeX? Unfamiliar with it.
Is it detrimental if I use Word instead?

### Second round of user interviews

Will be modifying my existing Qualtrics survey I developed for ethics approval earlier in the year.

#### Research questions for the user interview

What are the research questions we want?
Focus on error-checking? Whether it's intuitive?

#### User interview questions to ask / topics


#### Plan for user interviews

I will ask Greta to put the survey on Wattle for students of the ANU first year classics course to check out. Maybe send out a wattle blast to students?
Whoever responds, responds. 
Results will be easy to quantify in time for the thesis.

My plan is to have the user interview questions finalised, sent to Greta for review, and up by this Thursday.

### Implementation so far

Have implemented most of the functionalities discussed. Buggy but will absolutely suffice. Have started writing a "future work" section in the thesis for things I'd like to fix.

How explicit do we have to be about bugs? Do they worry about bugs a lot when examining the interface?

### Interface clarification questions (for Greta)

* Not sure how to incorporate divine father in the graph, or whether it's feasible/worth it at this point
* How to incorporate "OR" especially when there are multiple possible other parents (e.g. see "Zeus"). OR doesn't work here.
* Not sure about the "unusual births" phrase to describe born from an object, as all unusual births are classified under the umbrella "unusual births". So just left that as born from an object.
