## Action Items from previous meeting

1. Simplistic aesthetic changes:
    * Add MANTO ID under the "Also known as" - "MANTO ID: 8xxxx" - &#9745;
    * Fix width on page with cards - &#9745;
    * All lists in alphabetical order - &#9745;
2. Modify drop-down and search function:
    * Get rid of "entity" - change to "Search by name" - &#9745;
    * Leave in name and identifying information and get rid of number - and only search the name column not identifying information - &#9745;
    * Find a good react dropdown library that allows for style and embedded objects in search options - &#9731;
3. Set up Google Analytics for the website - it's already gotten X number of views from around the world - good for data - &#9731;
4. By next meeting, pick a graphing library / graphing infrastructure, and experiment with it.
    - GraphLib, no drawing, algos written in
5. Collectives - "Offspring of" (for some collectives only)
    - Very complex, will take some time. See the paper for more information.
    - Clean up the code so can do the collectives thing, and not all code is in on the one page. - &#9745;
6. Ethics approval updates
7. Import Greta's new files - &#9745;


## Meeting Agenda

### Research Question in One Sentence:

### What I'm currently working on:
*

### Upcoming dates to be aware of:

by 1st December (Ben and Greta away in December)
Have a oslid plan, finish the prototype
Start scholar user testing in Jan
Do student user testing in start of Sem 1 Feb

### Next step and what's getting in the way:

#### Search function issues
Already briefly modified the search text options (removed the manto ID and put back in the identifying information). However the search is less efficient now.
e.g. "Heracles" and "Zeus" will result in the actual intended hero/god showing up halfway down the page. 
This is due to the matching algorithm in the search - will see if I can modify that.

#### Gender database is missing entity
Danaos, father of the Danaids, is missing gender


### Other discussion topics
