# Meeting 10, DD/MM/YYYY

Completed: &#9745;
Unattempted: &#9746;
In progress: &#9731;
``` All comments from Ben and Greta are in these code blocks ```

## Action Items from previous meeting
1. Create icons for autochthony and parthenogenesis
2. Add icons for those as substitute for triangle and circle
3. Try every graph layout algorithm out there and determine applicability to greek mythology
4. Try all different styles of graph layout algorithms - e.g. ancestor fans and timelines and see how applicable they are to greek graphs
    - Potentially do user research on them to see whether genealogical graphs are actually best?
5. See if can implement Greta's suggestion for layered disputed parents (alternating views)
6. Need to make it obvous they're from different worlds. Make it obvious that it's NOT possible for someone to have more than 2 parents. (e.g. more like different alternative universes)
7. Use opacity and line width and strong colours to denote unusuality/points of interest
    - e.g. if Hero has only one option for mother, the mother's name is darker font.
    - e.g. if 3 fathers shown, then those are more transparent (e.g. 33% chance that this person is father") - showing the weighting of the tradition via the opacity - show the strength of the connection
    - e.g. Zeus has 2 passage references in Hera's graph - so make Zeus' node darker? Denotes more certainty
    - Could be more useful once more texts are imported into MANTO
8. Make all alternative parents (disputed) lighter font, show uncertainty . Find a way to show dispute in a more intuitive way. 
9. Make divine father more obvious, e.g. icon - thunderbolt
10. Figure out the big picture of the thesis:
    - Algorithmic?
    - Historical / research-focussed?
    - HCI/user-study-based?
    - Try to avoid terminology that results in computer science panel thinking it's an algorithms-developing thesis. My thesis is not a graph-layout problem! The problem is about showing data and how traditional genealogical data visualisations are inappropriate.
11. Determine how I can utilise the "digital platform" more - add what's not possible in a paper graph
12. Determine whether it's possible to trace back genealogies, e.g. trace Hera's genealogy back X generations, so that you can determine what event in her past caused an event in her present. Tracing DNA back. Timeline graph modelling?
