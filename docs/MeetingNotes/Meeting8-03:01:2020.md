### Greta's wish list of changes

9. Entities crashing site
    - Medousa
        Because in the database, Medousa has a geneology "Medusa is part of The Head of Medousa", which isn't an entity. Hence, error.
    - Ouranos
        Same with Medousa. Says is part of "the Genitals of Ouranos" which is not a collective. Inconsistency with undeng of use of "is part of". Should keep it consistent with just collectives.
    - Children of Iphicles and Pyrrha
10. Add sibling (sister/brother) reversal for when two agents have the same parents (e.g. X, Y is son of Z, A)
    - Example: Poseidon Neptune Olympian god, Zeus Olympian god, Hades Underworld god is son of Rhea Titan, Cronos Saturn Titan, father of Zeus
11. Add "is twin of" - &#9745;
12. Add "is older than" - &#9745;
    - Test with Heracles and Iphicles - &#9745;
12. Collectives - Cheiron is mentioned twice in "the Centaurs" - &#9745;
13. "Gives in marriage" geneological data, e.g. X gives in marriage Y [indirect object Z]
    - Also add in reversal -  Y is wife of Z
14. If parent is listed several times in different genealogies, the passage repeats itself (e.g. father in Amphithryon 8182163)
15. Make the links for geneologies more obviously clickable (more like the passages) - &#9745;
    - Just added underlines - &#9745;
16. Fix search function so prioritize names not identifying information
    - Find a better, alternative dropdown selector
    - Modify the search algorithm so it suits the above purpose (prioritize first over second)
17. FIx search so by clicking on the name it redirects to the new page.
18. Address grandparents, and relation to parents etc
