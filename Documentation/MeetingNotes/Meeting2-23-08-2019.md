# Meeting 2, 23/08/2019

## Action Items from previous meeting
*   Look at the existing tools (& play around with them) and what they’re capable of
    *   Github
    *   JS graph visualisation libraries
    *    Could generate a prototype 

## Meeting Agenda

### Research Question in One Sentence:

No idea at the moment – how to structure a research question for such a big project?

```
Can have one question with multiple answers:

- Visualising complex relationship
- Rewording title of project
- Experiences of different users
    - General users interested in Greek mythology
    - Cognoscenti – people who know stuff
        - Design an interface for different users? Or one for all?
Start with simple question, and in following paragraphs flesh out what this means.
```

### What I'm currently working on:

```
Use markdown to pdf workflows – pandoc (pandoc-citeproc) – through homebrew
Start making notes in markdown
```

* Created a GitHub repo for the project: https://github.com/yayalu/greekgraphs.git
* Will be using ReactJS for the frontend due to familiarity with it, possiblility in combination with TypeScript
*  Potential DAG Generation Libraries
    * DagreJS with Dagre-d3 for graph rendering
        1.    https://dagrejs.github.io/project/dagre-d3/latest/demo/clusters.html
        2.    https://github.com/arxenix/react-dagre-d3
        3.    http://ankursundara.com/react-dagre-d3
        4.    http://js.cytoscape.org/
        5.    Vis.js
        6.    Sigma.js
    * D3.js standard graph visualisation tool
* Currently just importing the CSV files
    1.    Parse the CSV datums
    2.    Conduct reverse-logical operations (X is grandfather of Y => Y is grandchild of X)
    3.    The aim is to generate all of the data cards before the next Friday or next meeting.
* Generate reverse datum table


### Upcoming dates to be aware of:
* September 17th – Lightning talks, 4 slides (1 introduction, 3 project), 3 minutes with 1 min questions.
* September 24th – Group discussions to talk about honours project issues
* University term break starting end of next week.

### Next step and what's getting in the way:
* Fixing the issues with the CSV parser rendering. 
* Create a list of logical operations to reverse 
* Finish creating a simple prototype
* Determine the appearance of the data cards

``` 
Parsing the CSV file in a script (in another language) and turn it into JSON, and make the react site load JSON
Anything that can load CSV and return JSON
Pandas – python package 


Do user tests over the summer
Figure out how to measure the effectiveness of the system

Qualitative analysis techniques

Research into the effectiveness of various graph visualisation techniques. 
-    CHI
Quantitative
-    Qualitative
-    Graph structure
Use to justify my approach to the 
Use to format the user evaluation questions, and explain how they’re based on existing literature.

Move everything (marks) to markdown files and to github

Check with Greta if she’s here during the break.

In future – a chapter that discusses the architecture of the project, why use ReactJS (really briefly).
```


## Action Items for Next Meeting (03/09/2019):
1. Convert all notes to Markdown
2. Put them all on Github
3. Email Greta about inconsistencies
4. Create Python CSV to JSON parser
5. Develop a simple prototype
6. Write agenda for next meeting
7. Create README.md file for the project and overwrite existing README on GitHub
8. Come up with a draft research question
9. Discuss lightning talk presentation the following week
10. Potentially discuss issue with conducting honours theses remotely.
