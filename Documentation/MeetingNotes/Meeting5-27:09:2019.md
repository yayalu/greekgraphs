## Meeting Agenda

### Recent Progress

#### Lightning Talks
* Great success! Lots of people loved our project.
* Presentation was pretty engaging, had a lot of people asking questions, received a lot of compliments.
* One audience member recommended the book "One hundred years of solitude" for dealing with anomalies and inconsistencies in names.

### Research Question in One Sentence:
Have not had time to make updates to the previous version.

### What I'm currently working on:

#### Disambiguation search page
Have completed the search function on the website. Have already uploaded it to github.
Was stuck on it for more than a week - my code was buggy and it took a while to debug
Just managed to complete it.


#### Ethics approval in ARIES
* Have created a new account in the ANU Ethics Approval platform ARIES.
* Will plan on watching the Ethics Approval video
* Have a copy of the ethics approval template, will go through the questions.

__Requirements:__
* List of indicative questions                            Y/N
* Copy of questionnaire / survey                Y/N 
* Invitation or introductory letter/s                Y/__N__ 
* Publicity material (posters etc.)                Y/__N__ 
* Information sheet                        Y/N 
* Consent form                                    Y/N 
* External approval documentation                Y/__N__ 
* Research visa (if applicable)                Y/__N__ 
* Other (specify below)                    Y/__N__ 

Need signatures from Ben or Greta once completed

*** Jochen has said that depending on the type of project, it might not require ethics approval? ***

__Suggestions for users:__

1. Greta - client
2. Other researchers in the humanities - ANU Greek Mythology professors?
3. Interested students with some background in the field - Semester 1 2020 Greek Mythology class
4. General population with no experience in greek mythology - public?

__Question types:__

Expectations (before):
* Expectations of the interface
* Expectations for what they will learn
* Expectations for simplicity

Interface:
* Task, navigating from one page to the other (Want to find the mother of certain entity, see if they can find it). 
* Do they click anything wrong? Is it intuitive?

Questionnaire (after):
* Likert scales with comments?
* Qualitiative analysis / interviews?


How many users would I want? How many different types of users is feasible?
A couple of big interviews in each category? Or lots of small, quick interviews in every category?
Incentive?


### Upcoming dates to be aware of:

#### Drop in session for the ethics approval 
Just missed the drop-in session for September (it is the second Wednesday of every month).
Monday after next, 9th October, before our next meeting.
Plan to complete a draft version of the ethics documents by then and show them in the drop-in session.

### Next step and what's getting in the way:

#### Overall website design
Noticed there is not a design for the whole website. Am considering drawing something up quickly in Sketch.

#### Decide which graphing algorithm I want to use

Most of these are good general graphing options, but not many allow middle links between two nodes, e.g. in geneological tree style. 
Did not have time to finish a fully-working prototype

Sugiyama style algorithm for family tree

__React-Dagre-D3__

https://dagrejs.github.io/project/dagre-d3/latest/demo/clusters.html

http://ankursundara.com/react-dagre-d3/

Pros:
* Based on the prototyping, maybe conduct some analysis.
* Trying react-dagre-d3 - a d3-based graphing tool designed for DAGs built on ReactJS.
* Has different designs for the graph edges - good for describing different types of relationships

Cons:
* Don't have middle links between two nodes

__Dagre-D3 or Dagre__

Uses type graphlib

* https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre-d3
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44038221/d3-js-family-chart
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31245751/how-do-you-create-a-family-tree-in-d3-js

*If can get this to work, this is our best option*

__dTree__

https://github.com/ErikGartner/dTree
Uses d3JS
Demo: https://treehouse.gartner.io/ErikGartner/58e58be650453b6d49d7

Pros: 
* Looks like a good family tree structure

Cons:
* Doesn't allow grandparent relationships (upwards hierarchy)
* Doesn't allow multiple spouses

__react-native-d3-tree-graph__

Pros:
* Has the middle-links between two nodes

Cons:
* Not sure if it's easily-modifiable
* Designed for react-native. Not sure if works for webpages

*If can get this to work, this is our second-best option*

__Cytoscape__

Pros: 
* Canvas-based, visually appealing

Cons: 
* Doesn't allow for middle-links between nodes

__Gephi__

Pros: 
* Canvas-based, visually appealing

Cons:
* Doesn't allow for middle-links between nodes

__SigmaJS__

Cons:
* Doesn't allow for middle-links between nodes


__VisJS__

Pros:
* A good visualisation tool, has a lot of community support

Cons:
* Closest thing to our geneology chart is "network"
* Can't do genealogy links (middle links between nodes), see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39096205/family-chart-with-horizontal-and-vertical-line-connectors-using-vis-js


__After consideration.......__
Honestly I feel like I should just create my own graphing algorithms. No current graphing algorithms are able to recreate the complexities of these relationships, or are flexible enough to modify for these. 
As such, I did not generate a prototype. I will try to come up with a graphing algorithm - do some research - before the next meeting.


### Other discussion topics

#### Goal for this project
Discussion with Jochen Renz during the last Honours Seminar. Discussed the possibility of doing a PhD at the ANU, hopefully getting a PhD Scholarship.
Apparently requires a First Class Honours, with a high GPA and publications.
Considered the possibility of publishing my project in a research conference next year:
* DHA (aaDH), around October 2020. Call for papers due around March 2020.
* DH2020 conference in North America, July 22-24 2020
The plan is to write up a paper in Sem 1, have it submitted and published BEFORE the honours is finished, so can use in the application for a PhD
Deadlines for PhD applications - one in April (for sem 2 2020), one in August (for sem 1 2021)

## Action Items for Next Meeting (11/10/2019):
1. Create a general design in Sketch for:
    * The website
    * The graph design
2. Come up with research questions for the ethics approval
    * Email Ben and Greta
    * Head to the drop-in session
    * Have at least submitted the ethics approval by next Friday
3. Have some working prototypes of the graphs using the different algorithms by next meeting
    * OR, start creating my own algorithm.
