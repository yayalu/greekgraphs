## Meeting Agenda

### Recent Progress

#### Lightning Talks
* Great success! Lots of people loved our project.
* Presentation was pretty engaging, had a lot of people asking questions, received a lot of compliments.
* One audience member recommended the book "One hundred years of solitude" for dealing with anomalies and inconsistencies in names.

### Research Question in One Sentence:
Have not had time to make updates to the previous version.

### What I'm currently working on:

#### Disambiguation search page
Have completed the search function on the website. Have already uploaded it to github.
Was stuck on it for more than a week - my code was buggy and it took a while to debug
Just managed to complete it.


#### Ethics approval in ARIES
* Have created a new account in the ANU Ethics Approval platform ARIES.
* Will plan on watching the Ethics Approval video
* Have a copy of the ethics approval template, will go through the questions.

*** Jochen has said that depending on the type of project, it might not require ethics approval? ***

### Upcoming dates to be aware of:

#### Drop in session for the ethics approval 
Just missed the drop-in session for September (it is the second Wednesday of every month).
Monday after next, 9th October, before our next meeting.
Plan to complete a draft version of the ethics documents by then and show them in the drop-in session.

### Next step and what's getting in the way:

#### Overall website design
Noticed there is not a design for the whole website. Am considering drawing something up quickly in Sketch.

#### Decide which graphing algorithm I want to use
Based on the prototyping, maybe conduct some analysis

### Other discussion topics

#### Goal for this project
Discussion with Jochen Renz during the last Honours Seminar. Discussed the possibility of doing a PhD at the ANU, hopefully getting a PhD Scholarship.
Apparently requires a First Class Honours, with a high GPA and publications.
Considered the possibility of publishing my project in a research conference next year:
* DHA (aaDH), around October 2020. Call for papers due around March 2020.
* DH2020 conference in North America, July 22-24 2020
The plan is to write up a paper in Sem 1, have it submitted and published BEFORE the honours is finished, so can use in the application for a PhD
Deadlines for PhD applications - one in April (for sem 2 2020), one in August (for sem 1 2021)

## Action Items for Next Meeting (11/10/2019):
